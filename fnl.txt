Secondary structure: structure that proteins form by hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atom of one amino acid, and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom of another amino acid
Selectively permeable: the characteristic of a membrane that allows some substances through but not others 
Semiconservative replication: the method used to replicate DNA in which the double-stranded molecule is separated, and each strand acts as a template for a new strand to be synthesized, so the resulting DNA molecules are composed of one new strand of nucleotides and one old strand of nucleotides
Septum: a partition formed between two bacterial daughter cells
Sexual reproduction: requires that two different gametes (egg and sperm) come together to form a zygote
Simple diffusion: a process where solutes move directly through the membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equilibrium is met
Sister chromatids: two identical chromosomes attached to one another at a location called the centromere region
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER): the region of the endoplasmic reticulum that has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface and synthesizes carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones; detoxifies chemicals like pesticides, preservatives, medications, and environmental pollutants, and stores calcium ions
Solute: a substance being dissolved in another to form a solution
Solution: a homogeneous mixture made of two or more components
Solvent: a substance capable of dissolving another substance
Somatic cell: all the cells of a multicellular organism except the gamete-forming cells
Speciation: a formation of a new species
Sperm: the male gamete; a haploid cell
Spliceosome: a structure composed of various proteins and other molecules, which attaches to the mRNA transcript and “splices” or cuts out the non-coding, introns
Splicing: the process of removing introns and reconnecting exons in a pre-mRNA
Standardized variable: variables that must be kept consistent otherwise, they can affect the outcome or results of the experiment
Starch: a storage carbohydrate in plants
Start codon: the AUG (or, rarely, GUG) on an mRNA from which translation begins; always specifies methionine
Steroid: a type of lipid composed of four fused hydrocarbon rings
Stoma: the opening that regulates gas exchange and water regulation between leaves and the environment
Stop codon: one of the three mRNA codons that specifies termination of translation
Stroma: the fluid-filled space surrounding the grana inside a chloroplast where the Calvin cycle reactions of photosynthesis take place
Substrate-level phosphorylation: production of ATP from ADP using the excess energy from a chemical reaction and a phosphate group from a reactant
Substrate: a reactant that binds to a specific enzyme
Surface tension: the cohesive force at the surface of a body of liquid that prevents the molecules from separating
Sympatric speciation: speciation that occurs in the same geographic space
Telomerase: an enzyme that contains a catalytic part and an inbuilt RNA template; it functions to maintain telomeres at chromosome ends
Telomere: the DNA at the end of linear chromosomes
Telophase: the stage of mitosis during which chromosomes arrive at opposite poles, decondense, and are surrounded by new nuclear envelopes
Temperature: a measure of molecular motion
Tertiary structure: a protein's three-dimensional conformation, including interactions between secondary structural elements
Tetrad: two duplicated homologous chromosomes (four chromatids) bound together by chiasmata during prophase I
Theory: a thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena
Thermodynamics: the science of the relationships between heat, energy, and work
Thylakoid: a disc-shaped membranous structure inside a chloroplast where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place using chlorophyll embedded in the membranes
Tight junction: a firm seal between two adjacent animal cells created by protein adherence
Tissue: a group of similar cells carrying out the same function
Tonicity: the amount of solute in a solution
Trait: a variation in an inherited characteristic
Trans-fat: a form of unsaturated fat with the hydrogen atoms neighboring the double bond across from each other rather than on the same side of the double bond
Transcription bubble: the region of locally unwound DNA that allows for transcription of mRNA
Transcription: the process of making mRNA from DNA
Transfer RNA (tRNA): transfer RNA; is an RNA molecule that contains a specific three- nucleotide anticodon sequence to pair with the mRNA codon and also binds to a particular amino acid
Translation: process of making a protein from the nucleotide sequence code of an mRNA transcript
Translocation: the process by which one segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome
Triglyceride: a fat molecule; consists of three fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule
Trisomy: an otherwise diploid genotype in which one entire chromosome is duplicated
Unsaturated fatty acid: a long-chain hydrocarbon that has one or more than one double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain
Vacuole: a membrane-bound sac, somewhat larger than a cyst, that functions in cellular storage and transport
Valence shell: the outermost electron shell
Variants: genotypes or phenotypes that deviate from the wild type
Variation: the variety of alleles in a population
Vesicle: a small, membrane-bound sac that functions in cellular storage and transport; its membrane is capable of fusing with the plasma membrane and the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus
Vestigial structure: a physical structure present in an organism but that has no apparent function and appears to be from a functional structure in a distant ancestor
Wavelength: the distance between consecutive points of a wave
Waxes: a type of lipid made up of a hydrocarbon chain with an alcohol (–OH) group and a fatty acid
