# Biology Vocabulary Hangman 🎓🧬

**Biology Vocabulary Hangman** is an interactive project that combines **biology education** with **computational tools**.  
It was originally implemented in **Python** using `graphics.py`, and later extended into a **web-based version** with built-in **statistical analytics and visualizations**.  
Together, these versions demonstrate my ability to integrate **life sciences, programming, and data analysis** — skills I aim to advance in graduate research in **bioinformatics, protein docking, and biostatistics**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
- A biology-themed version of the classic **Hangman** word game.
- Vocabulary sourced from a glossary (`fnl.txt`) based on **OpenStax Biology**.
- Two complementary implementations:
  - **Python version:** GUI-based game built with `graphics.py`.  
  - **Web version:** Interactive browser-based version with statistics and charts.

---

## 🕹️ Game Rules
1. A biology word is selected from the glossary and masked.  
2. The player guesses letters via on-screen or physical keyboard.  
3. Four incorrect guesses complete the hangman figure.  
4. On the **third wrong guess**, a biology-related hint is displayed.  
5. The word is revealed at game end, and the user may play again or quit.

## 📊 Statistical Features (Web Version Only)
The web version includes **data-tracking and analytics**, highlighting my interest in **biostatistics**:  

- **Cumulative Stats Panel**  
  Tracks games played, wins, losses, win rate, current streak, average wrong guesses.  

- **Auto-Updating Bar Chart**  
  Visualizes total **wins vs. losses** across all sessions.  

- **Win-Rate Trend Line**  
  Displays **win rate (%) over time**, showing learning and persistence trends.  

- **Local Storage Persistence**  
  Stats remain available between sessions and can be reset by the user.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
- **Professor Aana Varvak** for invaluable guidance.  
- **OpenStax Biology** for glossary resources.  
- Authors of *Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science* for the `graphics.py` framework used in the Python version.  

---

## 🚀 Try It
- **Python version**: Run `SelfProject.py` with Python (requires `graphics.py` and `fnl.txt`).  
- **Web version**: Open `.html` in a browser with `fnl.txt` in the same folder.  

---

## 📌 Graduate Application Note
- **Python version** shows my foundation in **programming and biology-focused educational tools**.  
- **Web version** extends the project into **data analytics and visualization**, demonstrating how biological information can be logged, analyzed, and communicated effectively.  

Together, these highlight my preparation for graduate-level work in **bioinformatics, protein docking, and biostatistics**, where programming and statistical modeling are essential.
