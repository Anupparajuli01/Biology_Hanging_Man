# Biology Vocabulary Hangman 

**Biology Vocabulary Hangman** is an interactive project that combines **biology education** with **computational tools**.  
It was originally implemented in **Python** using `graphics.py`, and later extended into a **web-based version** with built-in **statistical analytics and visualizations**.  
Together, these versions demonstrate my ability to integrate **life sciences, programming, and data analysis** skills. I aim to advance in graduate research in **bioinformatics, protein docking, and biostatistics**.

---

## Project Overview
- A biology-themed version of the classic **Hangman** word game.
- Vocabulary sourced from a glossary (`fnl.txt`) based on **OpenStax Biology**.
- Two complementary implementations:
  - **Python version:** GUI-based game built with `graphics.py`.  
  - **Web version:** Interactive browser-based version with statistics and charts.

---

## Game Rules
1. A biology word is selected from the glossary and masked.  
2. The player guesses letters via on-screen or physical keyboard.  
3. Four incorrect guesses complete the hangman figure.  
4. On the **third wrong guess**, a biology-related hint is displayed.  
5. The word is revealed at game end, and the user may play again or quit.

## Statistical Features (Web Version Only)
The web version includes **data-tracking and analytics**, highlighting my interest in **biostatistics**:  

- **Cumulative Stats Panel**  
  Tracks games played, wins, losses, win rate, current streak, average wrong guesses.  

- **Auto-Updating Bar Chart**  
  Visualizes total **wins vs. losses** across all sessions.  

- **Win-Rate Trend Line**  
  Displays **win rate (%) over time**, showing learning and persistence trends.  

- **Local Storage Persistence**  
  Stats remain available between sessions and can be reset by the user.

## Graduate Application Note
- **Python version** shows my foundation in **programming and biology-focused educational tools**.  
- **Web version** extends the project into **data analytics and visualization**, demonstrating how biological information can be logged, analyzed, and communicated effectively.  

Together, these highlight my preparation for graduate-level work in **bioinformatics, protein docking, and biostatistics**, where programming and statistical modeling are essential.
