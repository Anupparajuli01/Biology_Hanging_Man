# Hanging_Man

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The game is typically played by two or more players, where one player thinks of a secret word, and the other player(s) tries to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. In this project, the computer (Bot) will ask a user to guess the word.

# Specification of the Game
The game is played between a Computer and a Human. The human is required to guess the word that the computer has masked. The computer will select the random line from a text file “fnl.txt.” The text file is derived from the glossary of the biology book from OpenStax.
For this version, the game is only mouse-based. The user must click the letters shown in the display and win the game before they fail because of multiple incorrect entries.
The game ends when the word is correctly guessed or the stick figure is fully drawn. For this model of the game, the stick figure is fully drawn at four incorrect attempts regardless of the word length.
A hint would be available before the final chance to make the user focus more on the words and their spelling to enrich their vocabulary.
No statistics will be revealed in the game. The game would only prompt you if you won the game for that round or not.

# Rules of the Game
The game proceeds as follows:
• The user will be displayed with a graphical user interface for the game. Initially, the
guessing word is masked, gallows, and the keyboard is displayed.
• The user is supposed to guess the word and is allowed to click a letter.
• If the user guesses the correct letter, then the correct letter is unmasked from the masked
letter.
• There are four chances given to guess the masked word correctly. A hint will be provided
on the third failed attempt to guess the word correctly. Please get the word in four accurate shots to avoid a loss for the game. And it will pop you a button either to try again or quit.
• If the user clicks the try button again, then the user will be given a chance to play again.
